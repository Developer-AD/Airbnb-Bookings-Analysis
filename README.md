<h2> üìä Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>


<p>EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is a crucial step in the data analysis process where the primary objective is to gain a better understanding of the data before applying any statistical modeling or hypothesis testing. EDA involves examining and visualizing the data through various techniques to uncover patterns, identify outliers, detect missing values, assess data quality, and understand the relationships between variables. By conducting EDA, data analysts can make informed decisions about data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling strategies, ultimately leading to more accurate and meaningful insights. EDA plays a fundamental role in data-driven decision-making and helps guide subsequent steps in the data analysis pipeline.</p>
